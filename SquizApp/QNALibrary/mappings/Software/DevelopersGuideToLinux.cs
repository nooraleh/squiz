A command-line interface is a text-based environment for interacting with your computer that:
    1) Reads some input from you
    2) Evaluates (or processes) that input
    3) prints some output to the screen in response, and then
    4) Loops back to (1) to repeat that process.

Steps (1) - (4) are known as REPL

True or false:
    In the context of the command-line, some programs might accept short and long versions
    of a parameter, usually denoted by single- vs. double-hyphenation,

    E.g -l and --long might do the same thing.

read, write and execute the file.

The following three chars 'r-x' represent the 'group' permissions, in this case they can
read, not write, but execute the file.

The final three chars represent 'others' permissions, they too can
read, not write, but execute the file.

Let's talk about the common `init` term in Linux:
    a) What is the process ID of init
    b) What is init responsible for?
    c) Aside from systemd, what other init systems exist?

a) PID 1
b) init is responsible for:
    - managing the boot process
    - starting all other processes and services that have been configured to run on the system
    - re-parenting orphaned processes (i.e. processes whose original parents have died) and keeping
      them as its own children
c) Other init systems:
    - SysV
    - OpenTC

    - whether the service unit file has been successfully loaded and is ready to be started
c) Active state
    - current state of the service (can be either running, inactive, or failed) and how long
      the service has been in the current state (in this case 21 minutes)
d) Docs
    - the main page where you can find relevant documentation if it's been installed
e) Main PID and child processes
    - in this case the main PID is 278 and a child process 259 exists
f) Resource usage
    - 'Memory' is the RAM usage
    - a 'CPU' label will show the CPU time
g) CGroup
    - Details about the control group to which this process belongs
h) Log preview

a) If:
    - the service's configuration file has changed on disk since it was started
    - that config file now has a bug that prevents the program from sucessfully starting 
    
b) You can mitigate the risk by:
    1) testing the configuration on disk before restarting, e.g.
       for nginx you can run 'nginx -t' to test the configuration on disk.

    2)  - preferring 'reload' over restart i.e. 'systemctl reload <service>'
        - reload re-checks the configuration on disk to ensure the configuration is valid
        - reload re-reads the configuration into memory without interrupting the running process, if possible
        - reload restarts the process only after validating the config and making sure the process will start
          successfully after being stopped
        - note although that not all services support 'systemctl reload'

    - installed software and your own binaries are contained
    - anyone on the system and see and execute them
d) /var/log and /var/lib
    - /var contains variable data, things that are prone to change while the system is running
    - e.g. the application logs of /var/log
    - e.g. the dynamic libraries of /var/lib
e) /var/lib/systemd
    - one of several places on the filesystem that contain systemd configuration
f) /etc/systemd/system
    - a good place for custom system unit files, if you're creating services
g) /dev
    - a special filesystem used to represent hardware devices
h) /proc
    - a special filesystem used to query or change system state

3) Block special:
    - used for: provides buffered access to hardware devices, which makes
        them particularly useful for devices like hard disks where data is accessed in larged, fixed-size blocks
    - would only work with these directly for when mounting filesystems
4) Character special:
    - Similar to block special files
    - used for: procing unbuffered, raw access to hardware devices
    - handle data one character at a time, in a continuous stream
    - but they are designed for devices where data is not block-oriented, like keyboards or mice
